                    <p>Fig.1 PAGE analysis of Experiment 3-1<br>
                    (lane 1: Ladder (20 bp, 7 µL), lane 2: Output 1 (600 nM, 15 µL), lane 3: DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) (600 nM, 15 µL), lane 4: Output 1-DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) (600 nM, 15 µL))</p>
                    <p>Fig.1 shows that lane 1 prepared with sterile water migrated well, whereas lanes 2, 3, and 4 prepared with hybridization buffer did not. 
                        This could be due to the high salt concentration in the hybridization buffer. 
                        Therefore, we thought that there might be a problem with the hybridization buffer. 
                        We then performed electrophoresis under equivalent conditions, using sterile water for lanes 2 and 3, and hybridization buffer in lane 4 in Experiment 3-2.</p>
                <h3>3-2 Electrophoresis in Sterile Water</h3>
                    <h4>【Method】</h4>
                    <p>The polyacrylamide gel was prepared under the same conditions as those described earlier for electrophoresis in hybridization buffer, and electrophoresis was performed at 150 V, 15 mA, 35 min.</p>
                    <h4>【Results and Discussion】</h4>
                    <p>Fig.2 shows the results of Experiment 3-2.<br>
                    (Lane 2 and 3 are done with sterile water, and lane 4 is done with hybridization buffer.)</p>
                    <img src="images/experimentFig.2.png">
                    <p>Fig.2 PAGE analysis of Experiment 3-2<br>
                    (lane 1: Ladder (20 bp, 7 µL), lane 2: Output 1 (600 nM, 15 µL), lane 3: DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) (600 nM, 15 µL), lane 4: Output 1-DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) (600 nM, 15 µL) )</p>
                    <p>Fig.2 shows that the cells in lanes 1, 2, and 3 in sterile water migrated well, whereas those in lane 4 did not. 
                        While the peaks in lanes 1 and 2 appeared clear, a white peak was observed in lane 3, where the peak of DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) should have appeared. 
                        In addition, broad peaks were observed throughout the lanes. 
                        Presumably, this is due to the high concentration of the samples. 
                        Therefore, the sample concentration was diluted 2-fold, the buffer was changed to 1 × TAE/Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and electrophoresis was performed again in Experiment 3-3.</p>
                <h3>3-3. Electrophoresis at 2x dilution of sample concentration and 1 × TAE/Mg<sup>2+</sup> buffer</h3>
                    <h4>【Method】</h4>
                    <p>The polyacrylamide gel was prepared under the same conditions as those described earlier for electrophoresis in hybridization buffer in prior experiments., and electrophoresis was performed at 150 V, 15 mA, 35 min.</p>

                    <p>In Fig.3, broad peaks were observed in lanes 2, 3, and 4. 
                        This might be because the amounts of loaded solutions were too large. 
                        Therefore, the next step was to reduce the volume of liquid flowing into the wells and to perform electrophoresis with TBE as the buffer, which has a higher resolution than TAE.</p>
                <h3>3-4. Electrophoresis in 0.5 × TBE</h3>
                    <h4>【Method】</h4>

                    <p>Fig.4 shows that a single peak between 20 bp and 40 bp (peak 1) appeared in lane 2. 
                        Also, a single peak between 80 bp and 100 bp (peak 2) appeared in lane 3. 
                        In lane 4, three peaks have appeared, peak 1, peak 2, and a peak between 120 bp and 140 bp (peak 3). 
                        Peak 1 and 2 in lane 4 are Output 1 and DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) that were not hybridized. 
                        Since peak 3 is the sum of peak 1 and peak 2, we confirmed the success of hybridization of Output 1 and DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>).</p>

                    The release of Output 1 with the addition of C4-HSL (quormone) was confirmed by electrophoresis (PAGE).</p>

                    <p>Fig.5 shows that Output1 was not released at all concentrations. This is due to the fact that the concentration of C4-HSL was too low. Therefore, the next step was to add an excess amount of C4-HSL and perform the same conditions.</p>
                <h3>4-2 Electrophoresis in excess amounts of C4-HSL</h3>

                        The polyacrylamide gel was prepared under the same conditions as those described earlier for electrophoresis in hybridization buffer, and electrophoresis was performed at 150 V, 15 mA, 45 min</p>

                    <p>Comparing Lane 4 and Lane 5, it appears that the 120 bp-140 bp peak seen in Lane 4 has disappeared in Lane 5. 
                        Also, the Output 1 (32 bp) and DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) peaks of lane 5 seem darker compared to lane 4. 
                        Therefore, we inferred that under the existence of C4-HSL (quormone), the hybridized double-stranded DNA (Aptamer sensor) dissolved into two components.</p>

            <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
            <p>At first, we attempted double-strand formation of Output 1 and DNA Aptamer (Pool<sub>99</sub>) to create the Aptamer sensor by using hybridization buffer. 
                However, the salt concentration of the hybridization buffer was so high that double-strand formation could not be confirmed by electrophoresis (PAGE). 
                When we changed the buffer to 1×TAE/Mg2+, the double-strand formation was confirmed by electrophoresis (PAGE).<br> 
                In the next experiment, we confirmed the release of Output 1 from the Aptamer sensor when we added C4-HSL.<br>
                In conclusion, we confirmed that the Aptamer sensor (DNA aptamer - Output 1 (131 bp)) works as designed by the experiments.
